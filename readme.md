# Typescript Narrowing

Please run:

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
npm i
npm i -g ts-node
```

Go through the files and follow the instructions for each exercise.
You can use the command `ts-node FILE_NAME` to run the file (this should be a global package on your Mac)
Pay close attention to how typescript interacts with the IDE highlighting to help us code and catch type errors :)

Order of exercies:

1. discriminatedUnions.ts
2. typeGuards/typeOf.ts
3. typeGuards/instanceOf.ts
4. typePredicates.ts
